# water-boatman
A small chiptune synthesizer

## Description

Initially consisting of an Attiny85
microcontroller connected to a piezoeletric
buzzer, the first version of the water boatman
chiptune synthesizer will output 8-bit sounds.

## Mechanism

The piezo buzzer will be connected directly to
a PWM port of the Attiny85 which will receive
square wave 5V signals with a variable width.

## Buzzer

The [Buzzer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzer)
is a piezoelectric device that converts audio
electric signals in audio mechanic signals.
Thanks to Helmholtz effect, it is possible.
By variating the electric signal, its possible
to change the output audio frequency's, creating
music ðŸŽµ.

## Power source

The power soucer will be a 3V CR2032 or small lithium
battery. The Attiny will be underclocked to run with
voltages less than 5V consuming small amounts of power.
Probably, there will be a need to a voltage converter/
stabilizer.

The consumption will be about ~1.5mWh @ 5V,
according to the datasheet (0.30mA @ 6V).
Using the 235mAh capacity from CR2032 Energizer
datasheet, we can estimate >700 hours of
buzzer operation. Or ~ 3.5 years using 30 minutes
a day, which is more than enough for the first
iteration of the project.

### Putting Attiny85 in low-power mode

## Inspirations

[Attiny Synthesizer](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/attiny-synthesizer/439962)

## Inputs

The Attiny85 has 6 pins to be used for its
features. One of them will be used for audio
output, leaving other five for inputs (without
multiplexers). At the beginning, two pots and two
buttons can be using, with the fifth pin used for
a future display/Led strip implementation.
